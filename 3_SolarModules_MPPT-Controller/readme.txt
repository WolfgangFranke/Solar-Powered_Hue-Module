This folder contains how to build:
A Solar Charger to supply both, the Roller Blind and the ZigBee module, to let them work 24x7 independently from a wall socket (I use 2 cheap solar modules, an LT3256 MPPT solar charger controller, and made a Li-Ion battery emulator based on TL431 voltage adjustable shunt regulators).
